**Customer Purchase Prediction (CPP) - Puria & Milton**

The Customer Purchase Prediction (CPP) program is a Python-based machine learning tool we creatd that predicts whether a customer is likely to make a purchase based on their demographic and behavioral data. We provide the user with two models, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and Decision Tree, to analyze customer attributes such as age, gender, income, website activity, and loyalty program participation.

**Main Features:**

* Load and view customer datasets in CSV format.
* Train predictive models using K-NN or Decision Tree algorithms.
* Evaluate model performance through accuracy and classification reports.
* Simulate purchase predictions for new customer data entries.
* Optionally save model performance results to a text file.

**Dataset Information:**
The dataset used in this project originates from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-customer-purchase-behavior-dataset

To improve readability and simplify the dataset, we removed decimal points from the 'AnnualIncome' and 'TimeSpentOnWebsite' columns, as fractional values were unnecessary and had no impact on the functionality of our code.
